# A Simple password toolkit
### Generate passwords:

- Password length option.

- Character complexity (Symbols, Numerals...).

- Memorable password option.

- Generate pins and other types of keys.

### Analyze and Fortify passwords:

- Check for **weak** **patterns** in passwords, like **keyboard** **swipes** (ex: "QWERTY").

- Check for weak complexity.

- Detect possible **sensitive information** in the password (ex: Dates, Credit Card numbers).

- Fortify passwords by replacing weak patterns.
